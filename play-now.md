# Materials
To start a game of Elven Fire, there are a few common materials you will need to gather.

The Manual:
* from [CreateSpace](https://www.createspace.com/3666809)
* from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/Elven-Fire-Living-Vida-Medieval/dp/146620074X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1319926359&sr=8-1)
* [Online](/manuals/v3-0/Home)

Each player will need:
* A [character sheet](/game-aids/character_sheets), filled out
* A [marker](/game-aids/markers) representing their character (including a marker for any pet, etc.)
* Pencil with eraser
* [Dice](/game-aids/dice)

The Game Master (GM) will need:
* An adventure (such as one of the adventures below)
* [Room Maps](/game-aids/room-sheets) or laminated hex paper and whiteboard markers
* [Markers](/game-aids/markers) to represent creatures and items within the labyrinth

Other useful materials:
* [Markers](/game-aids/mulligans) to represent "mulligans"
* A copy of the [treasure table](/game-aids/treasures), at the very least

Note that before the game begins, the party should agree on which milieu they will be using on the treasure table.


# Designed Adventures

These are good adventures with which to start, created specifically for Elven Fire, and require a GameMaster to play.

## Books

* [Elven Fire for the Beginner GM](https://www.amazon.com/Elven-Fire-Beginner-David-Jace/dp/1478170328), filled with several campaigns tailored specifically for Elven Fire, complemented with detailed guides for those just getting started

## Mysteries

Not all is as it seems in these adventures - there's more to the plot than hack and slash!

* [Dark Reading](/adventures/dark-reading) (August 2013), in which the adventurers seek a valued book lost when a Lady's friend is killed in a remote labyrinth
* [Counter Strike](/adventures/counter-strike) (February 2014), in which the adventurers assist the intended victim of a hit to bring justice to the perpetrator
* [A Light in the Window](/adventures/a-light-in-the-window) (March 2014), in which the adventurers investigate a strange recurring light in a decaying, abandoned castle above a small island village
